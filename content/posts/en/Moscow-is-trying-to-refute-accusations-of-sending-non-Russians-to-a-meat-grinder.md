I am sure that the authorities of Moscow and the Moscow region, not without the complicity of the authorities of the Russian Federation, are trying to refute accusations of disproportionate mobilization of residents of disadvantaged depressed regions, including national Republics and the non-Russian population of “Russian” regions. To do this, the authorities are actively replenishing and forming the so-called Moscow military units and sending them into the meat grinder of Russian aggression against Ukraine.

This case was not without forgery and hypocrisy, as is customary in Russia. The fact is that these units are largely staffed from representatives of the Central Asian states (Kyrgyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks), various national Republics (Tatars, Dagestanis, Kalmyks, Chuvashs and others) and regions of the Russian Federation living and working in the metropolitan macro-region. They are often detained under various pretexts and forced into various forms of military service. Statistically, it turns out that the mobilized are residents of the capital and the region, but in reality, you yourself understand...

In addition, the Moscow authorities are solving another problem: reducing the number of non-Russians, incl. Muslims in Moscow and the Moscow region. Their authorities apparently see the non-Russians living there as a threat to public order in the face of Russia's gradual slide into collapse and anarchy.

The rights of Muslims in Moscow and the Moscow region are constantly grossly violated by law enforcement officers. Illegal actions of the police and the FSB, the prosecutor's office and the Investigative Committee standing behind it, regular police raids in mosques and prayer houses, incl. during prayers, are clearly racist and xenophobic in nature. Yesterday, a peaceful and "unauthorized" reaction to many years of arbitrariness and violence was the march of Muslims of various nationalities. After the Friday prayers at the Moscow historical mosque on Bolshaya Tatarskaya Street, the participants of the procession marched through the streets of Moscow, chanting "Allahu Akbar".

Forced mobilization of ethnic Non-Russian people is being conducted in many Russian cities.
