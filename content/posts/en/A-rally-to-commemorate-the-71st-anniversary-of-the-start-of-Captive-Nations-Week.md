The rally was attended by representatives of nations held captive by Russia and China.

Every year since the Cold War, or more precisely, since 1953, Captive Nations Week has been held in the United States.

Initially, the Week was initiated and organized to draw the attention of the American public to the Soviet occupation of the countries of Eastern Europe, the unfree situation of the peoples of the Soviet Union's Soviet republics and the states in other regions of the world occupied by communist regimes. This initiative was enshrined in Federal Law 86-90 signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959. Since then, U.S. presidents have annually declared the third week of July Captive Nations Week.

The observance of the Week, the protest and lobbying activities of émigré organizations over the decades played an active and significant role in U.S. efforts to contain and counter the threat of communist expansion and ultimately the global defeat of the USSR in the Cold War.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, most of the countries and territories mentioned in this Law became free from communist dictatorships and took the path of freedom from Moscow and formed independent states. Nevertheless, there are still hundreds of peoples and territories in unfreedom, under repression, bans and the threat of extermination, in colonial dependence, primarily in Russia and the PRC, including: Bashkirs, Buryats, Sakha, Tatars, Adyghe-Cherkesses, Oirat-Kalmyks, Ingush, Chechens, Karachai-Balkars, Erzyans, Avars, Laks and other peoples of Dagestan, Mari and representatives of other peoples oppressed by Moscow, as well as Tibetans, Uighurs, Zhuans, Mongols and other peoples of China.

In 2024, in the framework of Captive Nations Week (July 14-20), a series of rallies, mass demonstrations and pickets are held in various countries and cities of the world under the following main slogans: “Freedom and Independence!”, “Freedom to Captive Nations!”, “Russia is an Empire”, “Stop the Russian Empire!”, “ Freedom to Nations! Freedom to the individual!” and others.

In addition, the Congress of the Oirat-Kalmyk People and the Free Nations League will launch a Petition and send Appeals to the President of the United States, leaders of both houses of the U.S. Congress on the need to support our peoples in their quest for freedom, democracy, preservation, development and independence. After all, only true democracy, freedom, self-determination, sovereignty and independence can save our peoples from discrimination, repression, physical destruction and total extinction. As an expression of real support, representatives of national movements will unite in initiating the adoption of a new law on Captive Nations oppressed by Russia. The adoption of this law can contribute to the preservation of hundreds of thousands of lives, liberation, political self-determination and development of our nations.
