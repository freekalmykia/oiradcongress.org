Every year, on the third week of July, the whole world supports the nations held captive by empires and undemocratic regimes. We call on our like-minded people living in the US, the EU and Asian countries to come out and loudly and publicly declare:

I am for the freedom and independence of my republic or my land!
I am against the invasion of the Russian army in Ukraine!
I am against colonialism and despotism of Moscow!

Rallies will take place:

July 17th
US, New York City, at 12:00 PM, in front of the entrance to the United Nations main building.

July 23
US, New York City, at 3:00 PM, Times Square.
