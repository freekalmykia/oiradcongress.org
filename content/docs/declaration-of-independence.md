The Oirats have had several sovereign states in history. The last independent state of the Oirats  was liquidated by decree of Catherine II on October 19, 1771. The territory of the Oirat-Kalmyks was annexed and added to the Russian Empire.

On July 2–9, 1920, the First All-Kalmyk Congress of Soviets of the Working Kalmyk People  took place in the village of Chilgir, proclaiming the formation of statehood in the form of an  autonomous region within the RSFSR. It was attended by delegates representing all the Kalmyk  uluses of the Astrakhan and Stavropol provinces, Kalmyks living in the Don and Terek regions,  in Kyrgyzstan, in the Ural region and the Orenburg province.

The Kalmyk Autonomous Region was transformed on October 20, 1935 into the Kalmyk  Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was abolished on December 27, 1943, and the  Oirat-Kalmyk people were subjected to deportation and genocide.

On January 9, 1957, the Kalmyk Autonomous Region was re-formed as part of the Stavropol  Territory, which on July 29, 1958 was transformed into the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.

On October 18, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Kalmyk ASSR adopted the Declaration “On the  State Sovereignty of the Kalmyk Soviet Socialist Republic”. The Declaration solemnly  proclaimed the state sovereignty of the Kalmyk SSR throughout its territory and declared its  determination to create a democratic constitutional state, “based on the right of the Kalmyk  people to free self-determination and taking into account the desire of the people of Kalmykia for socio-economic progress, cultural revival and a radical increase in living standards, expressing  the will of the people of the republic to pursue an independent economic and social policy”.

However, all of the subsequent years were a time of step-by-step renunciation by the Kalmyk  authorities of sovereignty and the internationally recognized right of the Oirat-Kalmyk people to  self-determination — resulting from the collapse of the USSR, the formation of the Russian Federation, the election of an irresponsible adventurer as president in Kalmykia, who broke the  sprouts of democracy and freedom, and the strengthening of the authoritarian regime in Russia,  which finally became established with the coming to power of V. Putin. In 1994, by a  voluntaristic decision of President Ilyumzhinov and his supporters, as a result of an illegitimate  procedure, the pseudo-Constitution of the Republic of Kalmykia, the so-called Steppe Code, was  approved, in which the Republic of Kalmykia was recorded as a subject, not a state, as defined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation. After that, the entire policy of Russia towards the  Republic of Kalmykia was built on the basis of this limited status.

All authorities of the Republic of Kalmykia, without exception: previous and current presidents  and heads, members of the People's Khural (parliament), Governments and courts of the  Republic of Kalmykia did absolutely nothing to protect all the significant and fundamental  interests and rights of the Oirat-Kalmyk people, the entire multinational population and the  Republic of Kalmykia! The authorities of not-free Kalmykia turned out to be weak-willed  executors of the will of Moscow and helpless in defending the national interests of the people  and the Republic.

In the current conditions of Putin’s dictatorship, the following is happening:

* insane centralization and militarization of the country; 
* the Kremlin’s total attack on the cultures and languages of the non-Russian peoples conquered by Russia, and on their authorities and statehood in the form of national republics within the  Russian Federation; 
* the revival of the Russian Empire; 
* recreating and using the institutions and practices of the Nazi regime, Latin American and  African military dictatorships of the 20th century; 
* regular and cynical violation of generally recognized norms of international law;
* commission of international crimes and criminal offenses of an international character;
* a complete unilateral violation by the federal government of the terms of previously signed  federal treaties and the Constitution of the Russian Federation, obligations assumed by Russia in  relation to the peoples and national regions of the Russian Federation, including the Oirat Kalmyk people and the Republic of Kalmykia; 
* the constant disregard for the rights of repressed citizens, including survivors of genocide and  war crimes by the USSR, whose successor is the Russian Federation, so that the Russian Law on  the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples of 1991 is not enforced.

Chauvinism, racism, xenophobia, ethnic discrimination, rampant great-power hysteria,  admiration for Stalin and other monsters of the past are flourishing in the country; the territory  not being restored that was illegally torn from Republic of Kalmyia during the period of  deportation of the Oirat-Kalmyk people, the tearing away and annexation of territories of the  Republic of Kalmykia continues in favor of neighboring regions of Russia; the Russian  Federation is pursuing a colonial financial and economic policy that directly impedes the  economic development of Kalmykia, as a result of which there is a massive outflow from the  Republic and a decrease in the number of the Oirat-Kalmyk population, during all the years  following the return of the people from deportation, Kalmykia occupies the last place in USSR and Russia in terms of the provision of the population with drinking water, which contains clear  signs of genocide by Moscow, the opinion and interests of the people of Kalmykia are  completely discounted and ignored, the appointment of the leaders of the Republic by the  Kremlin uses undemocratic, falsified elections, the Republic is deprived of many of its own  governmental authorities, whose powers were unilaterally assigned by Moscow, the activities of  national organizations are suppressed, the terror of the federal authorities against civil and national activists does not stop...

In these absolutely unbearable circumstances, it becomes extremely clear that with further stay in Russia, Russification, assimilation, and degradation will continue, which threatens the very  existence of the Oirat-Kalmyk people.

Based on the foregoing, realizing its historical responsibility, the Congress of the Oirat-Kalmyk  people, as the only legitimate representative body of the Oirat-Kalmyk people, declares the need  for the complete liberation of the Oirat-Kalmyk people from colonial dependence on Russia,  declares its determination to seek the secession of the Republic of Kalmykia from the Russian  Federation, the proclamation and creation of a sovereign independent state.

The Congress of the Oirat-Kalmyk People believes that the creation of an independent state of  the Republic of Kalmykia is the most important and the only condition for preserving the native  language, culture, traditions, writing, national education, knowledge, various forms of activity, as well as the very existence and development of the Oirat-Kalmyk people.

The Congress of the Oirat-Kalmyk People appeals to all representatives of the Oirat-Kalmyk  people, wherever they live, to the entire multinational population of the Republic of Kalmykia — to support this Declaration in every possible way and be ready for the practical implementation  of the stated goal, to try to make their own contribution to the formation, strengthening and  development of the future free, independent and prosperous Republic of Kalmykia!

The Congress of the Oirat-Kalmyk People appeals to all states of the world, governments and  parliaments with a call to recognize the need to liberate the Oirat-Kalmyk people from the  colonial oppression of the Russian Empire and their legitimate right to self-determination and the creation of an independent state.

Let justice prevail!
